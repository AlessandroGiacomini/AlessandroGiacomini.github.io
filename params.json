Born in Sydney, Newson traveled extensively to Europe and Asia from at an early age. He works in various media and across multiple disciplines, having designed furniture, cars, household items, and sculptural works, among other projects. After graduating from the Sydney College of the Arts in 1984, where he studied sculpture and jewelry, Newson was awarded a grant from the Australian Crafts Counsel. Shortly thereafter, he designed and created his iconic Lockheed Lounge, a chair that has set multiple records at auction. Newson works with and for clients in a range of fields and businesses, such as fashion, manufacturing, and technology. His own companies include a watch brand and an aerospace design consultancy firm. He was part of Time Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2005, and received an honorary doctorate from Sydney University. Newson's work has been exhibited in various museums around the world, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Design Museum in London, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In addition to his career in Australia, Newson has lived and worked in Tokyo, Paris, and London, where he is currently based.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Gluon sofa project\r\n\r\nA revolutionary revolving chair designed by Marc Newson in 1993. The Gluon's seat and back are in steel covered with injected flame retardant foam. Sides in rigid lacquered polyurethane. A very comfortable piece with a striking modern look. An ottoman and a two seater sofa complete the range. Material available in either black, orange, or white. The innovative exterior results from the successful combination of colourful cushion and stylishly rolling steel frame.\r\n\r\n![Gluon sofa](https://github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/raw/master/images/1.jpg)\r\n\r\nBelow are shown the various components of the prototype developed using the Pyplasm module followed by the full prototype, resulting from the assembly of its various components. The model has been decomposed into many different parts.\r\n\r\n![Sofa_side (1)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/01)%20Sofa_side%20(1).jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sofa_side (2)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/02)%20Sofa_side%20(2).jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sofa_side (3)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/03)%20Sofa_side%20(1).jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sofa_pillow (1)](https://github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/raw/master/images/04)%20Sofa_pillow%20(1).jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sofa_pillow (2)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/05)%20Sofa_pillow%20(2).jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sofa_pillow (3)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/06)%20Sofa_pillow%20(3).jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sofa_base](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/07)%20Base_sofa.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Gluon sofa](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/08)%20GLUON%20poltroncina%20-%20Marc%20Newson.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Gluon sofa](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/9)%20GLUON%20poltroncina%20-%20Marc%20Newson.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Helice Floorlamp project\r\n\r\n\r\nMarc Newson Helice floorlamp designed in 1992 for Flos. This lamp is composed of aluminium, in 3 parts, connected by a cable inside the body. A color glass diffuser on top diffuses the downward light on the body. Silver lacquered body and blue glass.\r\n\r\n![Helice Floorlamp](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/1)%20Helice%20Floorlamp%20-%20Marc%20Newson%20JS.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ron Arad\r\n\r\n![Ron Arad](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/Foto%20Ron%20Arad.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Ron Arad** (Hebrew: רון ארד; born 1951) is an Israeli industrial designer, artist, and architect. \r\nArad was born in Tel Aviv. He attended the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem between 1971–73 and the Architectural Association in London from 1974–79. In 1989, with Caroline Thorman, he founded Arad Associates, an architecture and design firm, in London. His brother is theviolist and educator Atar Arad.\r\nArad's career as a designer began with the Rover chair. He was Head of Design Products Department at the Royal College of Art from 1997 to 2009.  Arad designed in 1994 the bookshelf Bookworm, which was still produced in 2011 by the Italian company Kartell. \r\nIn 2005, Arad designed chandeliers for the Swarovski crystal company which if one has the number, can display text messages that are sent to it by incorporating light-emitting diodes (LEDs) operated by SMS text messages. Arad's works are often worked into distinctive biomorphic shapes and are created from his medium of choice, steel. \r\nIn 2008, he designed the Bauhaus Museum in Tel Aviv. In 2010, Arad started his collaboration with New Eye London to design an eyewear collection. The global launch is planned in spring 2012.\r\nArad's installation “720 Degrees” opened at the sculpture garden of the Israel Museum in August 2012. It consists of 5,600 silicon rods that form a circle 26 feet above the garden. Visitors view projected images standing inside or outside the structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do Lo Res project\r\n\r\n“Do Lo Res” sofa is a very creative design by Ron Arad. Do Lo Res is a very up-to-the-minute sofa composed of several soft, square-based cube- or rectangular-shaped units of various heights. The units are arranged in rows to form the shape of the sofa, and fixed to a platform by steel pins. The units all have a 21x21cm footprint while varying in height from 27.5cm to 83cm. They are made of different-density polyurethane foam; a stiffer foam is used at the bottom of each unit in order to grip the steel pin, while softer foam at the top ensures optimum comfort. Do Lo Res units may be rearranged to form a wide variety of shapes and compositions. The “Do Lo Res” sofa is a product that is apparently very simple but which in fact has a great complexity of construction, structural and production.\r\n\r\n![Do Lo Res sofa](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/3.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to create the Do lo res’ sofa model it has been created the function “fpiecegenerator” that gets in input the number of the units, the high and the color chosen. The recursive use of such function allows you to create Do lo res’ sofa models of any kind and to dispose its rectangularshaped units  in any way.\r\n![Do Lo Res sofa function](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/1)%20DO%20LO%20RES%20-%20Ron%20Arad.jpg)\r\n\r\nBelow is shown the result of the assembly of its simple units.\r\n\r\n![Do Lo Res sofa (1)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/2)%20DO%20LO%20RES%20-%20Ron%20Arad.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Do Lo Res sofa (2)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/3)%20DO%20LO%20RES%20-%20Ron%20Arad.png)\r\n\r\n![Do Lo Res sofa (3)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/4)%20DO%20LO%20RES%20-%20Ron%20Arad.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Gino Carollo\r\n\r\n![Gino Carollo](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/Foto%20Gino%20Carollo.jpg)\r\n\r\nCombining purist elegance with relaxed Italian ease is the principle that Gino Carollo has made his own. He is an industrial designer who, from 1990 onwards, worked with leading international furniture manufacturers, before opening his own Studio Gino Carollo in 1999. He and his team offer the complete range of product design, from the initial idea to the finished product, and have built up long-term partnerships in the interior design sector as well. Gino Carollo's creations are exhibited all over the world, including in the New York MoMA, and have been awarded numerous design prizes. Among his fields of activity is the interior design and outfitting of exhibition premises and showrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Cubic bookcase project\r\n\r\nThe original shape of the Cubic bookcase , in addiction to the function of container for books and cds, it becomes a funny decorative object even suitable  for  strict spaces. Also the swivel shape makes possible the maximum use of the space. The Cubic bookcase is made of wood painted in black and white colors.\r\n\r\n![Cubic bookcase (1)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/1)CUBIC%20LIBRERIA%20GIREVOLE%20-%20Gino%20Carollo%20JS.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Cubic bookcase (2)](https://raw.github.com/AlessandroGiacomini/AlessandroGiacomini.github.io/master/images/2)%20CUBIC%20LIBRERIA%20GIREVOLE%20-%20Gino%20Carollo%20JS.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
